# Implementation of Small-Scale PHQ-Incorporated Depression Detection Conversational Agent

This repository contains the implementation of the proposed **Conversational Agent for Depression Detection**, built on top of the **DAIC dataset** (not included in this repository). The system integrates data augmentation, fine-tuning, and evaluation pipelines to create a chatbot capable of detecting depression indicators using conversational cues and PHQ (Patient Health Questionnaire)-based labeling.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Dataset Availability

This project is based on the **DAIC dataset**, which is **not publicly shareable here**.
To use this system:

* Request access to the DAIC dataset from the official community, **or**
* Replace it with a similar dataset of clinical or conversational depression detection.
