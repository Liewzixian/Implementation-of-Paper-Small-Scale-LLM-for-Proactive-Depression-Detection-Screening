    "    1. Read the cumulative summary and full conversation carefully and focus ONLY on the participant's sentiments, emotional expressions, and direct statements. Ignore therapist's parts unless they explicitly quote or reflect the participant's sentiment.\n",
    "    2. Identify explicit evidence for each PHQ-8 question from the participant's sentiment-related content.\n",

    "    4. For depression classification, assess based solely on mapped severities from participant sentiments (e.g., if multiple high severities in sentiments, classify as \"Depressed\").\n",
    "    5. Provide evidence as direct quotes/phrases from the participant's sentiments or \"no evidence\".\n",
